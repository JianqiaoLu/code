I just find that if you want to the contribution of updating one variable to the whole function value, then you may need to restrict that other variables' gradient is also very small;
Otherwise, it is to difficult to do the real calculation.
The conclusion is that we can actually get the fractional decrease of the function.
Although, I still don't know the intuition why I need to know this actually.
